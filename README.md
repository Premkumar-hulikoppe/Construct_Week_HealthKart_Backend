### **HealthKart Website Clone Project**

Hello everyone this is our third Construct Week Project at Masai School's Full Stack Web Development Course. We are currently at the end of fourth unit where we need to make projects as per mastery based progression environment of _Masai School_ after learnig certain tech-tools. And in fourth unit we have learnt node js, express js and mongoDB by using which we need to create website clones. So the motto of this project is to develop *HealthKart* website clone, which provides an online health platform to buy medicines at a good price with a variety of types and prices, also along with medicines daily life health products like protein supplements, medical testing kits, kid foods etc.

  So it was a great experience to us, while building this clone we have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever we have learnt in our current unit. The project covers basic front end designs up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Dhaval Chheda* and also instructor associate *Kamal Gupta* for guiding which helpled us alot to feel confident and work upon the project to complete within the specified deadline period.
